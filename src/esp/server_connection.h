/**
 * @brief ESP-IDF HTTP server WebSocket connection representing a single Sendspin server session
 *
 * Implements the SendspinConnection interface for the server role, where the ESP device
 * hosts an HTTP server and the Sendspin server connects to it as a WebSocket client.
 *
 * Manages:
 * - The socket file descriptor for the accepted connection
 * - Sending text messages (hello, state, time, goodbye, commands)
 * - The httpd handle reference (owned by SendspinWsServer)
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Created by SendspinWsServer when a new connection is accepted
 * 2. start() is called to begin message processing
 * 3. loop() is called periodically to handle time synchronization
 * 4. disconnect() is called to gracefully close with goodbye message
 *
 * @code
 * // Typical usage via SendspinWsServer (not constructed directly):
 * SendspinWsServer ws_server;
 * ws_server.start(port);
 * // SendspinWsServer creates SendspinServerConnection instances internally
 * // when incoming WebSocket connections are accepted.
 * @endcode
